Yes! Yes! Yes! My first shot of the Orion Nebula (annotated in next pic) that I’m satisfied with! It’s hard to believe this is possible with a DSLR and kit lens. 

I collected the data to generate the image on Tuesday 3/19. Edited this evening (3/21). 

I still have much to learn. In this image, my ISO was prob too high (causing noise) and my ad-hoc flat frames were garbage. I’m also trying to find my way around image editing software, so a re-edit may be soon. Finally, 5 minutes of exposure (aka integration time) is apparently peanuts even if it took an hour to take all the photos. So, I’ll definitely be figuring out how to streamline my setup to take more photos.
