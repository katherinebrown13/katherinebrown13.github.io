I’m slowly but surely working my way towards capturing the Orion Nebula. My first start-to-end project with my new DSLR! Stars are a tad unfocused, and cloud cover was not my friend. 

Objects: Orion’s Belt 

Camera: Canon T7

Settings: 55 mm focal length; f5.6

Software: Captured with AstroDSLR. Edited with Siril
