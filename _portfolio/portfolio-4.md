Some pictures from last night. A very casual shoot with a limited number of exposures and no calibration frames. Honestly, last night was going to be one of the best evenings until Thursday, so I figured Iâ€™d use the opportunity to practice and get used to some new equipment. Also, itâ€™ll be fun to come back to this in a few months to benchmark my progress :)

![Pleiades](/images/mar23-pleiades.jpg)
~~Hyades is a new one for me. Itâ€™s an open cluster in theâ€¦ checks notesâ€¦ Taurus constellation. Itâ€™s near the Pleiades star cluster which is on the target list. ~~
EDIT: I went back and checked: This is not Hyades, but Pleiades. Remember when I said I had a lot to learn...

![Orion (again...)](/images/mar23-orion.jpg)
Revisited Orion because itâ€™s an easy target from the back porch. You can faintly see 2 more nebulae: (1) Running Man Nebula which is above the Orion Nebula and (2) Flame Nebula which is around the leftmost star on Orionâ€™s belt. I think more exposures will bring these out. ðŸ¤©
