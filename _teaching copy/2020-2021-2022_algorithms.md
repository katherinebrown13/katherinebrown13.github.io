This course introduced sophomore CS students to algorithm design techniques and algorithm analysis. I served as instructor of record with duties including lecturing, preparing and grading written and programming assignments and exams. 

In Summer 2020, I prepared and taught an asynchronous online version of this course.

Topics Include:
- Time Complexity Analysis of Algorithms (including Master Theorem)
- Advanced data structures (e.g., graphs, heaps, AVL trees, Hash Tables) 
- Algorithm Design Techniques (e.g., Brute Force, Decrease-and-Conquer, Divide-and-Conquer, Transform-and-Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms)
