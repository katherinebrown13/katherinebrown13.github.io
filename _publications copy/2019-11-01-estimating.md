Recently, the application of deep learning to medical diagnosis has been an active area of research. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made the computational processing of medical imagesmore achievable. CNNs automatically extract important features from images that are then processed by an Artificial Neural Network to produce a prediction. Deploying CNNs in a clinical setting motivates a measure of the certainty of its prediction. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of various uncertainty measures on binary classification by CNNs.
