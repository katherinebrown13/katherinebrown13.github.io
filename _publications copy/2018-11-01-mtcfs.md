One approach to identifying which genes in a microarray are associated with a disease is to perform supervised feature selection using the presence (or absence) of the diseaseas the label guiding the process. Correlation-based wrapper feature selection (CFS) is one such approach. A wrapper feature selection technique uses accuracy metrics from predictive models to evaluate candidate feature subsets. Thismakes wrapper methods expensive. When studies involve multiple microarray platforms, each with a unique set of genes, the expense of wrapper-based CFS is multiplied by the number of platforms in the study. In this poster, we evaluate the ability of a multi-task learning approach to improve the efficiency of wrapper-based CFS across multiple simulated microarray platform.
