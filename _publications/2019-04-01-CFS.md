Feature selection plays a critical role in processing today's massive datasets. A popular wrapper-based feature selection technique, Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), heuristically searches the exponential number of possible feature subsets to find a subset with a high predictive power. In this work, we examine the ability of multi-task learning and heuristic subset decomposition to reduce the cost of using CFS. To do this, we describe and evaluate two algorithms, Multi-Task Correlation-based Feature Selection (MT-CFS) and Heuristic Decomposition Correlation-based Feature Selection (HD-CFS). Both algorithms utilize CFS on feature subspaces reduced by either a technique inspired by multi-task learning or a novel technique that heuristically subdivides the feature space for faster execution with minimal losses in accuracy. We conclude that HD-CFS shows promise as a standalone feature selection â€¦
